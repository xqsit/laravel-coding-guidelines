## What are Coding Guidelines?

Coding guidelines, also known as coding conventions or style guides, provide a set of recommendations and standards for writing code. These guidelines help ensure that the codebase is well-organized, readable, and follows established industry practices.

## Why Follow Laravel Coding Guidelines?

Adhering to coding guidelines is essential for maintaining code quality and consistency across projects. When developers follow a consistent set of standards, it becomes easier to collaborate, review code, and maintain the codebase over time. Consistent code also minimizes potential bugs and enhances the overall software development process.
